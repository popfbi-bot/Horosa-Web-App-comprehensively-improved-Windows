"""Regenerate HARNESS_MANIFEST.md — the tracked inventory of GITIGNORED build-harness files.

WHY: the Windows build harness (Electron shell, release scripts, the dev SKILL) is gitignored by
policy (ships inside the exe, not in the public repo). That makes silent loss invisible to git.
This manifest is the tracked record: file list + sha256 + purpose. `release_selfcheck.py`'s
`harness manifest fresh` gate recomputes the hashes and FAILS the release on any drift or missing
file — so a loss is detected, and the content is recoverable from the shipped exe's app.asar
(electron/*) or the release workflow docs.

Run from the repo root after ANY harness change, before release:
